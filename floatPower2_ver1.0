 * floatPower2 - Return bit-level equivalent of the expression 2.0^x

 *
 *   The unsigned value that is returned should have the identical bit
 *   representation as the single-precision floating-point number 2.0^x.
 *   If the result is too small to be represented as a denorm, return
 *   0. If too large, return +INF.
 * 
 *   Legal ops: Any integer/unsigned operations incl. ||, &&. Also if, while 
 *   Max ops: 30
